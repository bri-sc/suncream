    "# Big Data Assessment of Measurement Accuracy in Suncreams\n",
    "\n",
    "Suncream (also known as sunblock or suntan lotion) is an essential cosmetic product that protects skin from the sun's harmful ultraviolet (UV) light.\n",
    "The active ingredient in many suncream products is titanium dioxide, which absorbs the sun's harmful light, limiting its impact on our skin. \n",
    "However, companies that produce suncream frequently fail to report the amount of titanium dioxide in their products. \n",
    "\n",
    "Analytical scientists can use experimental measurements to estimate the amount of titanium dioxide in a suncream. \n",
    "This approach involves the calibration of instrumentation with samples of a known concentration. \n",
    "The calibrated instrumentation can then be used to estimate the titanium dioxide concentration in the unknown sample. \n",
    "Instrument calibration is an exercise in big data, and we must interpret our results using statistics and data modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started with Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, you may have interacted with a Jupyter Notebook. \n",
    "But before starting the data analysis, we will quickly refresh some important aspects. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Interface Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few parts of the Notebook interface that to draw attention to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The **Notebook/file tabs**. Similar to modern web browsers, JupyterLab allows many files to be open simultaneously within a tabbed interface. \n",
    "2. The **toolbar** contains buttons for common actions relating to working with Notebooks, hovering over the button with the cursor will pop up relevant information.\n",
    "3. The **cell**, which depending on the type, Python code or Markdown can be written in this box. \n",
    "4. Indictates if a cell has been run or not, when the cell has not been run it will read `In [ ]:` and run cells will have `In [x]:`, where `x` is a number that indicates the order that the cells were run. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/interface.png)\n",
    "Some important interface elements in the Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "Cells make up the body of a Notebook. \n",
    "When a new Notebook is opened, it will contain a single empty cell. \n",
    "Other cells can be added below the currently selected one by running the cell, pressing the \"+\" button in the toolbar or by using the keyboard shortcut of pressing \"B\" (the shortcut \"A\" can be used to add a cell above the currently selected one).\n",
    "Cells can be of different types, there are two particularly important ones to be aware of. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "A code cell contains Python code that can be executed. \n",
    "When the cell is run, the notebook will display any output from the final line of the cell in the corresponding cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/code-cell.png)\n",
    "An example of a code cell that has been run, the Python code in the cell performs the addition of 4 and 3 to give 7 as a return.\n",
    "\n",
    "A cell is run by either clicking on the &#9658; icon in the toolbar or using \"Control + Enter\" (Windows) or \"Command + Enter\" (macOS) on the keyboard.\n",
    "When the cell is run, the phrase should be printed below the code cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Markdown Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "The type of cell can be changed using the drop-down menu in the toolbar. \n",
    "After \"Code\", the most important type of cell is \"Markdown\". \n",
    "A markdown cell contains text that is formatted using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org), which is a lightweight markup language for writing HTML documents. \n",
    "When a markdown cell is \"run\", the markdown is formatted to HTML, and the formatted text is shown in place of the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/markdown.png)\n",
    "A markdown cell that has not been run yet, showing the raw markdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/markdown-rendered.png)\n",
    "The rendered markdown, with the nicely formatted equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Active Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "The currently active cell is indicated by being highlighted.\n",
    "The presence of the cursor, the blinking `|` symbol, indicates that the cell is currently in either the command or edit mode. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Command Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "When in command mode, the cell content cannot be edited but keyboard shortcuts can be used to cut, paste, and move whole cells. \n",
    "All of the keyboard shortcuts can be found [online](https://towardsdatascience.com/jypyter-notebook-shortcuts-bf0101a98330).\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/command.png)\n",
    "A Notebook cell in command mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Edit Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "From command mode, pressing Enter or clicking in the input text area of a cell will switch the cell to edit mode. \n",
    "When in edit mode, code or markdown can be written. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/edit-cursor.gif)\n",
    "A Notebook cell in edit mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How We Will Work\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, there are some code cells that you should run without modification and some that require editing. \n",
    "Those that require editing will have `◽◽◽` symbols in them and will raise an error if run without changing them. \n",

    "## Background \n",
    "\n",
    "Analytical scientists use the Beer-Lambert law to measure the concentration of a species in solution. \n",
    "The Beer-Lambert law has the following form, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A = \\varepsilon l c,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where, $A$ is the absorbance of a given wavelength of light by a solution of concentration, $c$, over a distance of path length, $l$, and $\\varepsilon$ is the molar absorption coefficient of the species of interest.\n",
    "$\\varepsilon$ is not generally known for a given species; therefore, it is necessary to produce what is known as a calibration curve. \n",
    "\n",
    "A calibration curve is made by making solutions of known concentration of the given species and measuring the absorbance. \n",
    "Since the relation above is linear, plotting this data will give a straight line where the gradient is $\\varepsilon l$ and $l$ is a component of the measurement device (this is also known to the scientist).\n",
    "\n",
    "With knowledge of $\\varepsilon$, it is then possible to rearrange the equation above to give, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "c = \\frac{A}{\\varepsilon l}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This rearrangement means measuring $A$ for some known new solution and estimating its concentration is possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, we will use this same process to estimate the concentration of titanium dioxide in a sample of suncream; we will also consider the error bounds on this measurement. \n",
    "First, we will read in a large dataset to provide an accurate estimate of the gradient and an uncertainty bound on this value. \n",
