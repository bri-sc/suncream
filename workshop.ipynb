    "# Big Data Assessment of Measurement Accuracy in Suncreams\n",
    "\n",
    "Suncream is an essential cosmetic product that protects our skin from harmful ultraviolet (UV)-light emitted by the sun. \n",
    "The active ingredient in many suncream products is titanium dioxide, which absorbs the hamrful light of the sun, limiting its impact on our sun. \n",
    "However, companies that produce suncream frequently fail to report the amount of titanium dioxde in their products. \n",
    "\n",
    "Analytical scientists can use experimental measurements to estimate the amount of titanium dioxide in a suncream. \n",
    "This involves the calibration of instrumentation with samples of a known concentration. \n",
    "The calibrated instrumentation can then be used to estimate the concentration of titanium dioxide in the unknown sample. \n",
    "Instrument calibration is an exercise in big data, where we must use statistics and data modelling to interpret our results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started with Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, you may have interacted with a Jupyter Notebook. \n",
    "But before we get started on the data analysis, we will quickly refresh some important aspects. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Interface Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few parts of the Notebook interface that to draw attention to ({numref}`interface`):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The **Notebook/file tabs**. Similar to modern web browsers, JupyterLab allows many files to be open simultaneously within a tabbed interface. \n",
    "2. The **toolbar** contains buttons for common actions relating to working with Notebooks, hovering over the button with the cursor will pop up relevant information.\n",
    "3. The **cell**, which depending on the type, Python code or Markdown can be written in this box. \n",
    "4. Indictates if a cell has been run or not, when the cell has not been run it will read `In [ ]:` and run cells will have `In [x]:`, where `x` is a number that indicates the order that the cells were run. \n",

    "### Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "Cells make up the body of a Notebook. \n",
    "When a new Notebook is opened, it will contain a single empty cell. \n",
    "Other cells can be added below the currently selected one by running the cell, pressing the \"+\" button in the toolbar or by using the keyboard shortcut of pressing \"B\" (the shortcut \"A\" can be used to add a cell above the currently selected one).\n",
    "Cells can be of different types, there are two particularly important ones to be aware of. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code Cells\n",

    "This book will focus on using Python but Jupyter Notebooks can support other programming languages; such as Julia, R, and Scala.\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "A code cell contains Python code that can be executed. \n",
    "When the cell is run, the notebook will display any output from the final line of the cell in the corresponding cell. \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A cell is run by either clicking on the &#9658; icon in the toolbar or using \"Control + Enter\" (Windows) or \"Command + Enter\" (macOS) on the keyboard.\n",
    "````{margin}\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "It is **strongly advised** to type code examples that appear in this book. \n",
    "Actively typing code gives one's brain more time to think about what it is doing, rather than passively reading it or copying and pasting. \n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "````{admonition} Task\n",
    ":class: important\n",
    "Nearly every introduction to programming resources starts with a [\"Hello, World!\" exercise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program), where you make the computer print the phrase \"Hello, World!\", and this course is no different. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Create** a new Notebook, **rename** the file to `Hello-World.ipynb` and into the first code cell **type** the following:\n",

    "````\n",
    "When the cell is run, the phrase should be printed below the code cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Markdown Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "The type of cell can be changed using the drop-down menu in the toolbar. \n",
    "After \"Code\", the most important type of cell is \"Markdown\". \n",
    "A markdown cell contains text that is formatted using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org), which is a lightweight markup language for writing {term}`HTML` documents. \n",
    "When a markdown cell is \"run\", the markdown is formatted to {term}`HTML`, and the formatted text is shown in place of the cell ({numref}`markdown-rendered`).\n",
